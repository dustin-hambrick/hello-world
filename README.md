# hello-world
Learning Git the right way.

My name is Dustin Hambrick, and I'm a Web Designer/IT Admin living in Arizona. My background includes HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Linux, Apache, SQL, Nginx, Adobe software and Ableton Live. Currently working on improving my coding skills which is why I'm here on GitHub (finally). 

The End.
